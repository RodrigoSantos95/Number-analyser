# Number-analyser ðŸ”¢

## Website built on HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript to analyse numbers 

In this application I was able to use the knowledge I got with JavaScript **DOM** manipulations, arrays and validation.<br> 
Basically, the user insert any numbers it wants under the rule that it's between 1 and 100 (both included). If the number inserted is out of this range, a message is shown telling that these numbers are out of the rule and then, ask the user to insert a valid number.<br> Then, when the number is valid, just press the button _Adicionar_. There is a row that will be filled with the added numbers. At any moment, just press the button _Finalizar_ and the application will show:

* The amount of numbers inserted
* The lower number
* The higher number
* The totam sum of all numbers
* The aritmetic media
